# Simple Crypto Web App - Typescript
## Description
A super simple web app, built using React and Typescript and no real prior experience. The app displays a list of the top 10 cryptocurrencies and some additional details. You can click on a cryptocurrency to see more details about it.

## Requirements
This project was made using `npm 10.7.0` and `npx 10.7.0`.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dewet99/octoco-crypto-app-ts
    ```
2. Change to the repo directory:
    ```bash
    cd octoco-crypto-app-ts
    ```
2. Get all the packages as listed in package-lock.json:
    ```bash
    npm ci
    ```

3. Run the following inside the cloned repo:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
4. The web app should open automatically inside your default browser.

## Usage
Click on stuff until stuff happens. That's about the extent of the functionality. To be more specific: click on the coin name, and the coin's details page will open.
